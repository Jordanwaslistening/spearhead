# Feature Highlight

## Microfrontend Orechestration

Spearhead is native micro frontend orchestration platform. What kubernetes is to docker spearhead is to micro front-ends. Spearhead also takes micro-front ends one step further by using them as plugins that can extend functionality of core without core code changes. A bit more about this can be found on our plugin starter kit. More about this feature and creating plugins can be found on the plugin starter kit repository below.

## Dev Tools Inspector Styling

This is very much an alpha feature. However, one that doesnâ€™t exist in any other platform that we have seen. Classes can be added and retained on pages using the the dev tools inspector. This makes it possible to style pages using tail wind css directly in the browser without changing any code. In the future will be extended to work with other attributes as well like styles, data attributes, etc. See the video on Youtube below for a demonstration.
